# Epidemic-Sim
An agent-based model designed to model epidemics with varying degrees of infectivity, lethality, vaccination rates, mask-wearing, hand-washing. Written in Python. Started Oct 2022.

## Introduction
This package allows you to model the course of an epidemic whilst altering settings such as virus infectivity and lethality, population size, vaccination rates, mask-wearing rates, hand-washing rates etc.

The effectiveness of each 'prevention measure' will be determined using data from peer-reviewed studies on their efficacy in order to increase the accuracy of the model in controlled conditions.

## Studies on prevention method efficacy
Below is a list of papers I have used to determine the efficacy of given prevention methods. This list will be updated as more data is used.

## Limitations
The real world is chaotic and extremely difficult to accurately model. This model should be used for demonstration purposes.
